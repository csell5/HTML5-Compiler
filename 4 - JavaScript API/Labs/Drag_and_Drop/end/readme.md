## Abstract

In this lab we're going to work through building a realtime chat system using WebSockets and node.js

- - -
## What will you learn?

In this lab you will learn the basics for creating and consuming a WebSocket.

* How to open a connection
* How to host an endpoint 
* How to broadcast a message across multiple clients
* How to send a message

Given the state of the WebSocket Spec we're actually going to use a library called Socket.IO to develop agaist.

## Prerequisites

* For purposes of this lab we're going to use node.js as a stand alone server for hosting our websocket endpoints and the pages that will consume them.
